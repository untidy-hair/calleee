calleee
======

*calleee* provides a wide collection of **argument matchers** to use with the standard ``unittest.mock`` library.

It allows you to write simple, readable, and powerful assertions
on how the tested code should interact with your mocks:

.. code-block:: python

    from calleee import Dict, StartsWith, String

    mock_requests.get.assert_called_with(
        String() & StartsWith('https://'),
        params=Dict(String(), String()))

With *calleee*, you can avoid both the overly lenient |mock.ANY|_, as well as the tedious, error-prone code
that manually checks |Mock.call_args|_ and |Mock.call_args_list|_.

.. |mock.ANY| replace:: ``mock.ANY``
.. _mock.ANY: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#any
.. |Mock.call_args| replace:: ``Mock.call_args``
.. _Mock.call_args: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.call_args
.. |Mock.call_args_list| replace:: ``call_args_list``
.. _Mock.call_args_list: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.call_args_list
